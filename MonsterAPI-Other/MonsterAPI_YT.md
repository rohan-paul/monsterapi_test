## ðŸ“Œ  Intro

Are you struggling with figuring out the right GPU resources for finetuning a language model?

Finding it difficult to setup a compatible GPU computing environment for your finetuning process? or struggling with many python libraries to integrated.

Not to worry any more.

MonsterAPI's no-code Large language model finetuner portal takes care of all the complexities for you and allows you to launch a fine-tuning job in a matter of minutes without writing a single line of code.

If you have a custom private dataset that you want to finetune ? No-problem. Monster's finetuning portal will accept any custom dataset for your custom finetuned LLM.

And then after finetuning you can deploy your custom LLMs as API endpoints using Monster Deploy. The Rest API endpoint can then be integrated into any public web or mobile application.

No-code fine-tuning is a breakthrough in the open-source world as it makes fine-tuning 10x more accessible to everyone.

## ðŸ“Œ MonsterAPI Supports 3 key Techniques

MonsterAPI has recently announced new features that make the platform even better. These include:

ðŸ“Œ QLora with 4-bit quantization and nf4: This feature reduces the size of the models by compressing them using quantization techniques. This allows users to fine-tune larger models using less memory and bandwidth.

ðŸ“Œ Flash Attention 2: This feature improves the speed and efficiency of training by using a novel attention mechanism that reduces the computational complexity of the models.

ðŸ“Œ Data and model parallelism on multiple GPUs: This feature enables users to train bigger models using larger context lengths by distributing the data and the model across multiple GPUs.

## ðŸ“Œ Background on why LoRA / QLoRA is great.

ðŸ“Œ Over the past year LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) has pretty much revolutionized finetuning and almost every finetuning job in the industry is using some form LoRA and QLoRA. So let's just quickly see why they have become so Important.

ðŸ“Œ The core idea behind LoRA is original weight matrix  W  is adapted by adding a low-rank product of two smaller matrices

ðŸ“Œ So when finetuning with LoRA, the original weights  W  are frozen, and only the elements of the low-rank matrices  B  and  A  are trained, leading to a drastic reduction in the trainable parameter count.

---------

ðŸ“Œ QLoRA (Quantized LoRA) further elevates this concept by introducing quantization into the mix. The mechanism is about reducing the precision of the elements in weight-matrices.

Instead of using high-precision floats (like 32-bit floating points), quantization represents these values with lower-precision formats (like 8-bit integers).

ðŸ“Œ This reduced precision means each number takes up less memory. For instance, an 8-bit integer uses 4 times less memory than a 32-bit float, leading to hugely faster calculations and a huge savings in compute-resource.

ðŸ“Œ The genius of this approach is in striking a balance between efficiency and model performance. While quantization introduces some approximation errors, the impact on model accuracy is typically minor, especially when fine-tuning on specific tasks where the adaptation scope is limited.

And now Monster API supports QLora with upto as low as 4-bit quantization and again without writing any code.
